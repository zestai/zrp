When you run `python -m zrp download` as a part of the ZRP installation process, you download pipeline files needed for the ZRP to make predictions. These pipeline for predictions based on the block group model are filed in this directory (read more about the pipelines in the `releasing doc <../../../releasing.rst>`_). The source code in the `/src` folder is employed by the pipeline to transform data into features, and make predictions.
