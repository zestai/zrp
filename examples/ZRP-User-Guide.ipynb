    "Zest Race Predictor (ZRP) is an open-source toolset that predicts the race and ethnicity of an individual based only their full name and location. It is more accurate than the current proxying method (BISG) and, by providing a better yardstick to measure bias and discrimination, it promises to improve equity outcomes in fair lending and other critical sectors such as health care, criminal justice, employment, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, the financial services industry has been dogged by charges of discrimination. Part of the problem is the use of flawed fair lending analysis tools. You can’t fix what you can’t measure. And, right now, all the fair lending tests are off. The approval rates for Blacks and whites are wrong. Based on our analysis, millions of African Americans are currently being wrongly misclassified as white.  Tens of millions of white Americans are being misclassified as people of color.\n",
